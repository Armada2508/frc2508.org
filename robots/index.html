      <b>The Robot:</b>
      <p>
        For the Crescendo challenge, our robot was designed to efficiently take in notes and shoot them into both the Speaker and Amp  elements by using vision software. Utilizing pneumatics which were implemented following catastrophic damages we sustained at the  Great Northern Regional, Galleon is able to stow its entire intake / shooting mechanism within itself. Our robot uses pathfinding  to automatically center itself onto a chain thus allowing the drivers to move forward and perfectly balance onto the chain.

        <b>The Challenge:</b>
        <p>
          The 2024 challenge Crescendo presented by Haas features music themed elements in the game pieces and field elements. Alliances  must design a robot capable of placing Notes, torus shaped game pieces, into a lower goal called the Amp, or shooting them into a  higher goal called the Speaker. At the end of the game, robots either attempt to score more notes, or begin climbing on a chain at  their respective alliances stage. Once on the stage, robots can attempt to core an additional note into the Trap, located above the  Stage.

      <b>The Robot:</b>
      <p>
        This year, for the Charged Up challenge, we designed a robot to move both types of game pieces and at the end, balance on the charging platform utilizing a balancing algorithm. This robot specialized in moving the cones and as such had a mechanical arm with a mechanism on the end to make sure all cones picked up were in the upright position. At the end of the match, using the algorithm previously mentioned, we would balance onto the charging station.

        <b>The Challenge:</b>
        <p>
          Charged Up, the challenge for 2023 presented by Haas is a energy themed competition. Each alliance must design a robot to pick up the cone/cube game pieces along with balancing on a seesaw type mechanism called the charging station. There are 3 levels of height to put the cone and cube pieces on with the bottom row being a hybrid section that both cone and cubes can go in. At the end of the match, all robots can either continue to place game pieces, or go to the charging station to balance.

      <p>
        Our robot for the Rapid React challenge focused on defense and climbing. During the autonomous phase, we would drop one ball into the lower goal. Throughout the main portion of the match we played defense by holding onto the opponents balls and blocking them from shooting. Before the end, we would get ready at the 4 bars and once it was time to climb, we would go directly to the upper  bars. We got to the top bar every match.

          Rapid React, presented by The Boeing company was themed around transportation. Each alliance of teams would have to shoot foam balls called Cargo into the central hub to score points. At the end of the match, each alliance could either score more cargo,  or go to their teams Hanger to climb the rungs for another way to score points.

          Infinite recharge was a partnership with Lucas Film. The matches were centered around a futuristic city modeled after Star Wars. The objective of the game was to prevent an astriod from hitting the city by shooting powercells into generators.  You would activate the generators by shooting foam balls into high and low goals. At the end of the match, robots would return to the shield generators to score additional points.

          Recycle Rush is a recycling-themed game and during it, two teams compete simultaneously to score points by stacking Totes on  Scoring Platforms, capping those stacks with Recycling Containers, and properly disposing of Litter,  represented by pool noodles, in designated locations. In keeping with the recycling theme of the game, all scoring elements used are reusable or recyclable by teams in their home locations or by FIRST at the end of the season.

          Aerial Assist is played by two competing teams on a large field, straddled by a  truss suspended just over five feet above the floor. The objective is to score as many balls in goals as possible during  a match. The more Alliances score their ball in their goals, and the more they work together to do it, the more points  their Alliance receives.

          Logo Motion incorporated the FIRST logo as game pieces. Each Alliance must hang as  many of the logo game pieces (inflated triangles, circles, and squares) on the scoring  grids located on each end of the field as possible. The higher a game piece is hung  on the grid, the more points the alliance receives.  Any logo piece hung on the same  peg as an Ubertube receives double points. If the logo pieces are assembled in the order of the FIRST logo (triangle, circle, then square) the points for the row are doubled.

          Robots play Breakaway on a large rectangular field. Robots direct soccer balls into goals, traverse "bumps" in the field,  suspend themselves and each other on towers, and/or go through a tunnel located in the center of the field.The field is bordered by a  set of guardrails and alliance walls. During the game matches, the robots are  controlled from alliance stations located outside the ends of the field. These rectangular zones consist of three team player stations that provide connectivity between the controls used by the robot operators and the arena. Goals are located at the corners of the field, and extend behind the alliance and adjacent to the player stations. After goals are scored, human  players must pick up the balls and pass them to the center of the alliance station to be placed on a ball  return rack, after which they will re-enter play at midfield. Teams are penalized if balls are not re-entered  within a set time limit.

          The goal of LUNACY is to score as many of the game pieces in the opposing side's trailers as possible. Robots start  out in front of the opposite alliances' human players. There is a 15-second autonomous period, during which robots  operate according to programs that teams download to their robot, and a 2-minute Teleoperated period, where robots  are driven and controlled by a human drive subteam at one end of the field. Empty cells (also worth 2 points) must be  handed to a robot by the "payload specialist" at the mid-field position known as the "outpost". The robot must deliver  the Empty Cell to their human player on one of the corners in order to get a Super Cell that is worth 15 points. A robot  can only carry one Empty Cell at a time. Super Cells can only be put into play during the last 20 seconds of play, and  only if the human player has been delivered an Empty Cell.

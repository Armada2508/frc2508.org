    For the Crescendo challenge, our robot was designed to efficiently take in notes and shoot them into both the Speaker and Amp 
    elements by using vision software. Utilizing pneumatics which were implemented following catastrophic damages we sustained at the 
    Great Northern Regional, Galleon is able to stow its entire intake / shooting mechanism within itself. Our robot uses pathfinding 
    to automatically center itself onto a chain thus allowing the drivers to move forward and perfectly balance onto the chain.
  challenge: >
    The 2024 challenge Crescendo presented by Haas features music themed elements in the game pieces and field elements. Alliances 
    must design a robot capable of placing Notes, torus shaped game pieces, into a lower goal called the Amp, or shooting them into a 
    higher goal called the Speaker. At the end of the game, robots either attempt to score more notes, or begin climbing on a chain at 
    their respective alliances stage. Once on the stage, robots can attempt to core an additional note into the Trap, located above the 
    Stage.

    This year, for the Charged Up challenge, we designed a robot to move both types of game pieces and at the end, balance on the
    charging platform utilizing a balancing algorithm. This robot specialized in moving the cones and as such had a mechanical arm
    with a mechanism on the end to make sure all cones picked up were in the upright position. At the end of the match, using the
    algorithm previously mentioned, we would balance onto the charging station.
  challenge: >
    Charged Up, the challenge for 2023 presented by Haas is a energy themed competition. Each alliance must design a robot to
    pick up the cone/cube game pieces along with balancing on a seesaw type mechanism called the charging station. There are 3 levels
    of height to put the cone and cube pieces on with the bottom row being a hybrid section that both cone and cubes can go in.
    At the end of the match, all robots can either continue to place game pieces, or go to the charging station to balance.

    Our robot for the Rapid React challenge focused on defense and climbing. During the autonomous phase, we would drop one ball into
    the lower goal. Throughout the main portion of the match we played defense by holding onto the opponents balls and blocking them
    from shooting. Before the end, we would get ready at the 4 bars and once it was time to climb, we would go directly to the upper 
    bars. We got to the top bar every match.

    Rapid React, presented by The Boeing company was themed around transportation. Each alliance of teams would have to shoot foam
    balls called Cargo into the central hub to score points. At the end of the match, each alliance could either score more cargo, 
    or go to their teams Hanger to climb the rungs for another way to score points.

    Infinite recharge was a partnership with Lucas Film. The matches were centered around a futuristic city modeled after Star Wars.
    The objective of the game was to prevent an astriod from hitting the city by shooting powercells into generators. 
    You would activate the generators by shooting foam balls into high and low goals. At the end of the match, robots would return to
    the shield generators to score additional points.

    FIRST Power Up is a game that has a retro 8-bit theme and teams are required to place milk crates, 
    or "power cubes", on large balancing scales to tip the scale and gain ownership. Alliances can also trade power cubes for 
    power ups, giving them a temporary advantage in a match. At the end of the match, robots can climb 
    the tower attached to the centre balancing scale using a rung attached to the tower, giving them additional points.

    represent fuel into a simulated boiler which transfers the generated steam into an airship in the middle of 
    the field. Each alliance has one airship, which they pressurize with steam from the boiler and load with plastic 
    gears from the field. At the end of the match, robots can climb and hang on team-supplied ropes attached to 
    the airship for additional points.

    grids located on each end of the field as possible. The higher a game piece is hung

    peg as an Ubertube receives double points. If the logo pieces are assembled in the
    order of the FIRST logo (triangle, circle, then square) the points for the row are doubled.

    Robots play Breakaway on a large rectangular field. Robots direct soccer balls into goals, traverse "bumps" in the field, 
    suspend themselves and each other on towers, and/or go through a tunnel located in the center of the field.The field is bordered by a 
    set of guardrails and alliance walls. During the game matches, the robots are 
    controlled from alliance stations located outside the ends of the field. These
    rectangular zones consist of three team player stations that provide connectivity between the
    controls used by the robot operators and the arena. Goals are located at the corners of the
    field, and extend behind the alliance and adjacent to the player stations. After goals are scored, human 
    players must pick up the balls and pass them to the center of the alliance station to be placed on a ball 
    return rack, after which they will re-enter play at midfield. Teams are penalized if balls are not re-entered 
    within a set time limit.

    The goal of LUNACY is to score as many of the game pieces in the opposing side's trailers as possible. Robots start 
    out in front of the opposite alliances' human players. There is a 15-second autonomous period, during which robots 
    operate according to programs that teams download to their robot, and a 2-minute Teleoperated period, where robots 
    are driven and controlled by a human drive subteam at one end of the field. Empty cells (also worth 2 points) must be 
    handed to a robot by the "payload specialist" at the mid-field position known as the "outpost". The robot must deliver 
    the Empty Cell to their human player on one of the corners in order to get a Super Cell that is worth 15 points. A robot 
    can only carry one Empty Cell at a time. Super Cells can only be put into play during the last 20 seconds of play, and 
    only if the human player has been delivered an Empty Cell.
